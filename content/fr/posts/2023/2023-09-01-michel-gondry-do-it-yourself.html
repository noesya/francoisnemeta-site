        <p>If Méliès had a son, it would be Michel Gondry. A brilliant  jack-of-all-trades whose eccentric talent convinced the creative elite  of international pop music to entrust him with his music videos (Björk,  the Rolling Stones, Daft Punk, The White Stripes, Beck, etc.) before  allowing him to chart his own course in Hollywood—without ever  renouncing his rather crazy style—and to become one of the rare  Oscar-winning French filmmakers (<em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>).<br> From hand to eye, Michel Gondry has been offering us for thirty years to  seize what surrounds us to create and tell the world. A work that is a  constant praise of wonder through craftsmanship : whether we approach his  relationship to music and his beginnings as a videographer; the notion  of magic inherent in his conception of the image; its roots in childhood  and the world of dreams; the paradox of his Hollywood career; and the  humanist ambition of its craftsmanship... which is also a political act.  Do it yourself.</p>

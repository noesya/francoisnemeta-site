        <p>If Méliès had a son, it would be Michel Gondry. A brilliant <br>jack-of-all-trades whose eccentric talent convinced the creative elite <br>of international pop music to entrust him with his music videos (Björk,<br> the Rolling Stones, Daft Punk, The White Stripes, Beck, etc.) before <br>allowing him to chart his own course in Hollywood—without ever <br>renouncing his rather crazy style—and to become one of the rare <br>Oscar-winning French filmmakers (<em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>).<br><br>From hand to eye, Michel Gondry has been offering us for thirty years to<br> seize what surrounds us to create and tell the world. A work that is a <br>constant praise of wonder through craftsmanship : whether we approach his<br> relationship to music and his beginnings as a videographer ; the notion <br>of magic inherent in his conception of the image ; its roots in childhood<br> and the world of dreams ; the paradox of his Hollywood career ; and the <br>humanist ambition of its craftsmanship... which is also a political act.<br> Do it yourself.</p>
